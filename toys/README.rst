=====================================
Vim Python Extensions (VPE) toy demos
=====================================

The demos in here have no practical purpose (other than being example code).
The toys are:

hanoi.py
    This runs an animation of solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. It
    demomstrates:

    - Creating simple (no subcommands) commands.
    - The uses of Timer callback functions.
    - Display/scratch buffers.

sokoban.py
    This is a clone of an existing Vim script:

        https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=211

    It demomstrates:

    - Creating simple (no subcommands) commands.
    - Display/scratch buffers.
    - Ways to highlight text using Vim's text properties.
    - Creating key mappings that directly invoke Python code.
    - Associating arbitrary data with a buffer using the Buffer's store
      mechanism.
